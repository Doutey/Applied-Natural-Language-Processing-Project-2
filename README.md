# Leveraging-World-Knowledge-in-Implicit-Hate-Speech-Detection
Maintaining a secure online environment is significantly hampered by the identification of hate speech in social media language. This study uses a transfer learning strategy and a sentence transformer model to improve the accuracy of hate speech identification. In the preprocessing procedures, stopwords, special characters, and numerical values are eliminated. Lemmatization is also used to standardize word forms. Techniques for class balancing are used to address the dataset's class imbalance. The goal of these preprocessing methods is to increase the model's precision in identifying hate speech. 
The RoBERTa architecture, a cutting-edge model of language representation, served as the foundation for the sentence transformer model used in this work. We take advantage of the RoBERTa model's pretraining on a large corpus to fine-tune it through transfer learning, capturing contextual data and semantic linkages important for hate speech identification. The effectiveness of our suggested strategy is evaluated through experiments in comparison to standard procedures. In the baselines, the sentence transformer model is applied without any significant preprocessing or class balancing. For binary and multiclass classification tasks, we assess the models using measures such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. 
The outcomes show that our method, when used in conjunction with preprocessing methods and class balancing, produces results that are more accurate than the baselines. We attain a 79% accuracy in binary classification when separating hate speech from non-hate speech. We successfully classify many kinds of hate speech using multiclass classification, with an accuracy of 78%. These results demonstrate how preprocessing and class balancing effectively improve hate speech identification.
